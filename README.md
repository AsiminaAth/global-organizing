# global-organizing

Repository to track global organizing as well as to suggest new project teams.

## Monthly Meeting

Monthly meetings are held the second Wednesday of the month at 1:00pm EDT.  

To attend, add the [event to your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MWo5ZjU2bzFvNmVlMmZrY3Ftc3MzY2FpazlfMjAxOTA2MDVUMTcwMDAwWiBweWZvdW5kLm9yZ19wOTc0Mms2cGswZmNqZDY1b2xwamJjYXY2Y0Bn&tmsrc=pyfound.org_p9742k6pk0fcjd65olpjbcav6c%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL).

_Monthly Agenda_

Each month an issue will be opened, using the monthly meeting issue template. We'll use this template to track discussion items, assign priorities, and add to our project board.
