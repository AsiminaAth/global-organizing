## Monthly Meeting

Monthly meetings are held the first Wednesday of the month at 7:00pm EDT.  

To attend, add the event to your [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MnJscW1vOTlrb2l2NnVzdnBtZmhoZDE4cHJfMjAxOTA2MDVUMjMwMDAwWiBsb3JlbmEubi5tZXNhQG0&tmsrc=lorena.n.mesa%40gmail.com&scp=ALL).

_Monthly Agenda_

Each month an issue will be opened, using the monthly meeting issue template. We'll use this template to track discussion items, assign priorities, and add to our project board.

## Notes
