# PyLadies Projects

The PyLadies Project teams were kick started in an effort to provide other means of participation for PyLadies members while also increasing the ability of PyLadies to manage itself as an open source project. See the [Request for Comment issue](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/33) for information.

## Contributing to a Project 

Any self-identifying PyLadies member can participate as a contributing member. Additionally each project will require a project lead or project leads. Any project member can self-nominate or nominate another person to be a project lead. If nominating another to be a project lead, the individual must be a self-identifying PyLadies member and their consent will be required (e.g. an email sent to the person and they consent to participate).

Membership as a PyLadies member, therefore, will rely on self-identification.

Additional requirements to consider:

- Basic communication in English or ability to alternatively contribute to the project team through English (e.g. a local volunteer can help include updates in English representing volunteers from a geographic region). Please note that the language(s) a Project team can support depend on the members of the team, if additional languages are needed please note in your proposal (see below) or contact that project team directly.
- Reasonably responsive on email, GitHub, and Slack

## To start a project

1. Open up a new issue outlining the scope of the project, project team members information, and other requested details with [this template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project-proposal.md). 
2. Solicit feedback and members in the [PyLadies Slack](https://slackin.pyladies.com/) using the channels #general and #project-proposals.
3. Get approval from the PyLadies Global Admin Team (the issue template automatically tags `cc/@pyladies/pyladies-global-admin`).

## Existing Project Teams

### [Admin and Logistics](https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics)
Creating new chapter and password reset require PyLadies Admin account in GSuite. However, other activities like reviewing chapter requests and other email communication do not require an admin account. As such, Project lead(s) should be one of the PyLadies Admin account, however team members can be any self-identifying PyLadies member. 

### [Communication](https://github.com/pyladies/project-communications)
A team to handle the Global PyLadies Communication and Engagement work. Work includes managing comms as it relates to interchapter communication and managing digital assets (e.g. blog, Slack). As such, Project lead(s) should include at least one seasoned PyLadies Chapter organizer, however team members can be any self-identifying PyLadies member.

## Proposed Project Teams

### [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/34) 
As an organization situated beneath the Python Software Foundation, PyLadies is subject to the PSF Code of Conduct. Additionally as a global organization we should offer a place for PyLadies to handle our own incident reports as well as have discussion related to any Code of Conduct considerations. Most importantly, though, this project team would offer support to our chapter organizers in training, knowledge acquisition, and more.

### [Finance](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/36)
While there is a Python Software Foundation Grants program, PyLadies itself has a central set of finances available that could be better used to support our global chapters. Examples may include expanding financial aid at global Python conferences, having finance options available for chapters to obtain t-shirts, stickers, or other swag. Lastly, this group could help determine what to invest finance in and consider ways to help fundraise on behalf of PyLadies.

### [Technology and Infrastructure](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/35)
Maintaining PyLadies technology will be scoped to helping maintain pyladies.com, helping chapters with setting up their websites under the pyladies.com domain, and anything else that may be needed for the PyLadies chapters technology needs.

## Possible Project Teams

### PyLadies at PyCon(s)
Looking at PyCon US as an example, PyLadies has a presence at PyCon US with programming including the PyLadies auction, PyLadies lunch, and the PyLadies booth. This project team can help build out similar programming at other global Python conferences as well as offer input on the size of PyLadies financial aid benefits for global Python conferences. Examples of work to be done include developing reusable assets, documentation on what PyLadies at PyCon programming may mean, and performing outreach to get a team that can help setup and staff events.

### Resources
Many new PyLadies chapters ask common questions such as “what is your chapter doing this month” and may ask for example lesson(s) or tutorial(s) to run in their chapter. This project team will help curate chapter specific resources and manage those resources on https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies-chapter-resources. Additionally, helping chapters with onboarding would fall under this project team’s purview.
