# RFC: PyLadies Governance Timeline

More context: https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/32

We need board elected June 2020 , same timeline as PSF board election as a way to work together
with PSF and to help continue to discuss gender diversity in the Python community

Proposed timeline:

- April is PyCon US and this is where publication starts to recruit Board Directors
- Important Rule: Geographic rule, no more than ⅓ from the same continent, have a good representation 
- Blend election/chosen people
- 5 people elected, 4 people selected to the appears to be the trending favored election combination on the GitHub issue
- 5 elected will have a term of 2 year, 4 selected (if use above method) 1 year otherwise the 5 with 2 year term vs 4 with 1 year term will be selected based on the election method selected

Please read [the doc](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/32). Speak out if you need help translating;
timeline for RFC feedback extended to **December 4 2019 EOD AoE**

## Feedback:

### Q: How should we consider the  timeline without  having translated the governance  issue?

- Brasil needs more time, want to have a meeting with Brasil communities, @deboraazevedo  will start on translation
Come up with a hard deadline of approximately 1 month. 

- **Proposal**: 
  
  - Do we want to translate to all official UN languages? 
  - Or should we use the Chapter Directory responses to guide us? We are going to talk on GitHub issue about this more.  

- Will share proposals on GitHub issue for continued discussion

- Translation costs are hard to pin, while PyLadies has a fund, ~ 1/3rd is used for pyladies grants at pycon us, how much do we have to translate? Unclear if we can spend at this point in time.

### Q: How will we announce the election?

- We need a well articulated presentation to answer “why”, we can open a GitHub issue to start working on this
- We need to start publicizing this timeline in early 2020
- Include experienced PyLadies organizers into this discussions. People from Southeast Asia, Russia, etc.
- PSF Updates from @lorenanicole:
  - PSF is supportive of PyLadies governance moving forward by mid next year
  - A PyLadies rep will be an officer of the PSF. @lorenanicole will be writing something about it.

# Centralize PyLadies groups

We are continuing to build the PyLadies Chapter Directory with the outreach email @lorenanicole has been sending,
