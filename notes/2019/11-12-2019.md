Projects started: Project Comms (https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/17) and Project Admin & Logistics (https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/3)

Next Project: We need to open the Project Infra / Tech (https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/35)

We will close out the [issue](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/33) and document in the repo under [processes](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/blob/master/process/pyladies-projects-overview.md)

### PyLadies Member Database

We will need to be able to contact PyLadies members to either vote or nominate themselves for the forthcoming PyLadies Global Council election.  We need this in place by at least Apr 1 2020.

Issue for tracking work: https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/54. @lorenanicole and @bethanyg will lead that.

### PyLadies Chaptter Policies

Should we allow country wide chapters? We need to write a policy to pass to the Project Admin & Logistics team to implement. 

As there is a Project Communications team @mariatta will open issues to address there including:

- How to start a chapter: https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/issues/8
- Country specific chapter: https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/issues/9
- How to deactivate a chapter: https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/issues/10
- How to make "unofficial" chapters official: https://github.com/pyladies/project-admin-logisitics/issues/11)

### PyLadies Slack Policies - Etiquette and Welcome Message

@bethanyg added in language for this at - https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/pull/44 - which has since been merged.
